# Introduction

The primary experiments are conducted using the original version of the network, **FL-net(CNN)**. Additionally, we provide two variant versions of this network:

- **FL-net(CNN)**: This variant incorporates convolutional layers to perform feature extraction experiments.

- **FL-net(alpha)**: In this version, all normalization layers in the original network are replaced with Layer Normalization (LayerNorm).

These variations are provided to explore the effects of different architectural modifications on the performance of FL-net.
